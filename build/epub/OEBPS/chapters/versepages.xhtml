<blockquote class="dhp-verse" id="page1">
  <p>With an image of liberation as the goal<br />
the wise abandon darkness and cherish light,<br />
leave petty security behind<br />
and seek freedom from attachment.<br />
To pursue such release is difficult and rare,<br />
yet the wise will seek it,<br />
detaching themselves from obstructions,<br />
purifying heart and mind.</p>

  <p><em>v. 87-88</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="dhp-reflection">The Buddha offers images that illustrate the goal, uplifting and
supporting us in our effort to let go of that which obstructs and limits
us. If we hold too tightly to the images, we may lose perspective on the
here and now element of the journey; instead of actually doing the
practice, we are imagining it. If we fail to give right emphasis to the
goal, we may become lost in the distraction of sense objects – agreeable
and disagreeable. The pursuit of true freedom is difficult, but consider
how much suffering comes if we don’t practice. With wise reflection we
find we can endure the dark and difficult times. When the light returns,
we cherish it and discover how to love truth more fully.</p>

<blockquote class="dhp-verse" id="page2">
  <p>Live your life well in accordance with the Way –<br />
avoid a life of distraction.<br />
A life well-lived leads to contentment,<br />
both now and in the future.</p>

  <p><em>v. 169</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="dhp-reflection">With a heart of contentment as our foundation, we can tackle the tasks
that confront us. There are times when we need to be brave warriors
battling with the forces of delusion to avoid their taking control of
our hearts and minds. At other times we need to be like a parent,
nurturing and caring for the goodness that is already here. Agility is a
great spiritual virtue. Recognising the beauty inherent in a contented
heart, we will naturally be drawn towards it. We only seek distraction
because we don’t know contentment. Right practice liberates energy
previously consumed by compulsiveness. This same energy can also
manifest as vitality and enthusiasm.</p>

<blockquote class="dhp-verse" id="page3">
  <p>Just as a sweet-scented and beautiful lotus<br />
can grow from a pile of discarded waste,<br />
the radiance of a true disciple of the Buddha<br />
outshines dark shadows cast by ignorance.</p>

  <p><em>v. 58-59</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="dhp-reflection">We tend to see the things we don’t like about ourselves and others as
obstructions to our happiness. ‘How radiant, how fulfilled I would feel,
how acceptable I would become if only I didn’t have all these
limitations!’ But everything we experience can be turned around and can
nourish growth towards that which is inherently, timelessly beautiful.
All the unfair, unwanted, unreasonable stuff of our lives, all the bits
that we resist and reject, make up the swampland of discarded waste. The
beautiful lotuses take root and grow in the unbeautiful.</p>

<blockquote class="dhp-verse" id="page4">
  <p>It is wisdom<br />
that enables letting go<br />
of a lesser happiness<br />
in pursuit of a happiness<br />
which is greater.</p>

  <p><em>v. 290</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="dhp-reflection">The filters of our preferences tragically limit our seeing. We want to
let go of that which binds us, but often our will fails us. Wise
reflection can support will – it is will’s best friend. Will is not
meant to do it alone. The verse encourages us to reflect on how letting
go of our attachment to a lesser happiness can lead to gaining a greater
happiness. Lost in our attachments, we see only that which we stand to
lose by letting go. Wise thinking means we see what we stand to gain as
well as what we stand to lose. Wise reflection opens and broadens our
vision and enables pursuit of the goal.</p>

<blockquote class="dhp-verse" id="page5">
  <p>Since ancient times it has been the case<br />
that those who speak too much are criticised,<br />
as are those who speak too little<br />
and those who don’t speak at all.<br />
Everyone in this world is criticised.<br />
There never was, nor will there be,<br />
nor is there now,<br />
anybody who is only blamed or wholly praised.</p>

  <p><em>v. 227-228</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="dhp-reflection">Whatever we do in this life, whatever we say (or don’t say), we cannot
avoid being criticised. The Buddha was blamed and criticised just like
everyone else. To seek only praise and fear blame is fruitless. The only
blame with which we really need to be concerned is that which is offered
by the wise. If someone who lives impeccably criticises us, it is
appropriate to heed what they say. But if we find that any criticism
from anybody hurts us, then we need to look deeper. Reflect that in
blaming, people are sending out the pain that they don’t have the
ability to contain; they express their hurt outwardly by finding fault
with others. When we have the mindfulness and capacity to receive
ourselves fully, we are not inclined to blame anyone, neither ourselves
nor others.</p>

<blockquote class="dhp-verse" id="page6">
  <p>If you find a good companion<br />
of integrity and wisdom,<br />
you will overcome all dangers<br />
in joyous and caring company.</p>

  <p><em>v. 328</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="dhp-reflection">Our mind, like water, takes on the shape of the vessel in which it is
contained. The Teacher is encouraging us to be mindful of the company we
keep. The Discourse on Great Blessings says, “Avoid the company of the
foolish and associate yourself with the wise”. As we apply skilful
discrimination, we need to exercise care that we don’t confuse prejudice
with wise discernment. Wise discernment is compassionate and kind, and
is interested in protecting all beings from harm.</p>

<blockquote class="dhp-verse" id="page7">
  <p>As a stormy wind cannot move<br />
a mountain of rock,<br />
so one who contemplates the reality of the body,<br />
who develops faith and energy,<br />
is unmoved by Māra.</p>

  <p><em>v. 8</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="dhp-reflection">Māra is the manifestation of unenlightenment, the driving force of
denial. Māra is the avoidance of reality and is expressed as
compulsiveness, insensitivity, resentment. Our monastery in rural
Northumberland is sometimes buffeted by winds that can be frightening,
but they are nothing compared to the threat posed by the forces of Māra.
If we are to withstand the onslaught of our heedless habits, we must
firmly establish our contemplation in an awareness of the body, in faith
and in energy. It is the ability and willingness to come back, over and
over again, to our body-based practice, remembering to live in ways that
lead to selfless confidence, that sustains our interest in discovering
truth. This has the power to make us unshakeable.</p>

<blockquote class="dhp-verse" id="page8">
  <p>Self-mastery is the supreme victory –<br />
much more to be valued<br />
than winning control over others.<br />
It is a victory that no other being whatsoever<br />
can distort or take away.</p>

  <p><em>v. 104-105</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="dhp-reflection">Unshakeably established in the centre of our lives, nothing can unsettle
us or generate causes for suffering. This is fearlessness. The Buddha’s
teachings point to that which blocks fearlessness: habitual
self-seeking, deluded desire. Shining the light of awareness on this
very activity of desire – not judging or interfering with it in any way
– we learn to see that each small moment of self-mastery leads towards
the victory of selflessness.</p>

<blockquote class="dhp-verse" id="page9">
  <p>Silence does not denote profundity<br />
if you are ignorant and untrained.<br />
Like one holding scales,<br />
a sage weighs things up,<br />
wholesome and unwholesome,<br />
and comes to know both the inner and outer worlds.<br />
Therefore the sage is called wise.</p>

  <p><em>v. 268-269</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="dhp-reflection">The Buddha spoke of the contentment and benefit that can come from
living in quiet and beautiful places. Limiting sense stimuli can assist
us on our path to freedom from ignorance. However, he didn’t mean for us
to then take a position against the sensory world. Ajahn Chah often
said: “If you can’t practise in the city, you can’t practise in the
forest.” And he’d also say: “If you can’t practise when you are sick,
you can’t practise when you are healthy.” In other words, everything is
practice; including the feeling that we can’t practise with ‘this’. It
is wisdom that recognises this truth.</p>

<blockquote class="dhp-verse" id="page10">
  <p>There are those who awaken from heedlessness.<br />
They bring light into the world<br />
like the moon<br />
emerging from clouds.</p>

  <p><em>v. 172</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="dhp-reflection">On the full moon day of the month of Asalha, over two thousand five
hundred years ago, the Buddha first revealed the Four Noble Truths. The
hearts of those who heard these teachings were filled with the joy of
perfect understanding, as cool and brilliant as a moon emerging from a
covering of clouds. We assume the world and our suffering to be more
substantial than they really are. But if we turn our attention towards
the true causes of suffering – desire rooted in ignorance - these Four
Ennobling Truths generate a radiance that disperses the clouds of
delusion and dissolves the world of suffering. Our contemplations awaken
us from heedlessness, moment by moment we contribute to the continued
turning of this Dhamma Wheel.</p>

<blockquote class="dhp-verse" id="page11">
  <p>Do not seek the company of misguided friends;<br />
beware of degenerate companions.<br />
Seek and enjoy the company of well-guided friends,<br />
those who support insight.</p>

  <p><em>v. 78</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="dhp-reflection">How do we hold our friendships and how do our friends hold us? We want
to protect and nurture true friendship with those who support our
aspiration to live in truth. We genuinely appreciate such companions; we
don’t wait until we get into difficulties before letting them know what
they mean to us. Good friendship can be cultivated. As we bring
mindfulness to our relationships with others, let’s also consider how
friendly we are being with ourselves.</p>

<blockquote class="dhp-verse" id="page12">
  <p>Those who build canals<br />
channel the flow of water.<br />
Arrowsmiths make arrows.<br />
Woodworkers craft wood.<br />
Those committed to goodness<br />
tame themselves.</p>

  <p><em>v. 145</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="dhp-reflection">Crafts-people work their crafts. The endeavour of taming the heart’s
unruly nature – there’s an art in that. Outwardly we may find ourselves
in confusing circumstances, but inwardly we remember that cultivating
skilfulness is our primary task. With careful, constant observation we
learn to recognise the heart’s unruliness. ‘If only the weather was
warmer!’ ‘If only the weather was cooler!’ We don’t reactively judge
what arises. Our passionate demanding that conditions be other than how
they are is simply seen for what it is. There’s an increased daring and
willingness to offer ourselves into whatever it is we are doing right
now; whole-heartedly, whole-bodily. As we progress, the task becomes
easier; gratitude manifests, even though the work is challenging.</p>

<blockquote class="dhp-verse" id="page13">
  <p>Why is there laughter?<br />
Why is there joy<br />
when the world is on fire?<br />
Since you are clouded in darkness<br />
should you not seek the light?</p>

  <p><em>v. 146</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="dhp-reflection">It is usually when we get burned by life that we turn to the Teachings.
It can come as a relief to find that in our efforts to be free from
darkness we are accompanied by many millions of other human beings.
Suffering is the nature of unawakened humanity. “Don’t feel bad if you
are suffering. Everyone suffers,” Ajahn Chah would tell us. Before his
enlightenment the Buddha-to-be suffered too. The difference is that
enlightened beings know that suffering is not an obligation – it is only
one of the options available in the human realm. There is also the
possibility of dwelling in the light of non-suffering.</p>

<blockquote class="dhp-verse" id="page14">
  <p>Gradually, gradually,<br />
a moment at a time,<br />
the wise remove their own impurities<br />
as a goldsmith removes the dross.</p>

  <p><em>v. 239</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="dhp-reflection">No amount of wishing things were otherwise gives us what we long for. We
want the pure gold of pristine awareness, so we need to enter the fires
of purification. This verse instructs us on how to watch over the
burning. Too much heat: we are trying too hard; enduring heedlessly, we
get hurt in our practice. Not enough heat: shying away from
difficulties, following preferences for comfort and ease; there is no
improvement in our practice. We just become more foolish as the years go
by. Our habits are the dross, and with gradual fine-tuning of our effort
we learn letting go. The aim of all this work is the realisation of the
state of luminous awareness. We then have something inherently valuable
to share with others.</p>

<blockquote class="dhp-verse" id="page15">
  <p>Better than ruling the whole world,<br />
better than going to heaven,<br />
better than lordship over the universe,<br />
is an irreversible commitment to the Way.</p>

  <p><em>v. 178</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="dhp-reflection">Unconditioned freedom: a quality of being not dependent on any condition
whatsoever. Whatever the circumstances, fortunate or unfortunate, the
heart remains at ease, radiant, clear-seeing, sensitive and strong. It
is a commitment that is irreversible, unshakeable and real: beyond all
of deluded ego’s obsessions. To arrive at this level of resolve requires
constant observation of our old habits, for example the fondness of
being in control of everything, addiction to passing pleasures,
obsession with power. We work with what we have. Each time we find
ourselves distracted, we refocus our commitment to the Way.</p>

<blockquote class="dhp-verse" id="page16">
  <p>Only blessings can arise<br />
from seeking the company of wise<br />
and discerning persons,<br />
who skilfully offer both admonition and advice<br />
as if guiding one to hidden treasure.</p>

  <p><em>v. 76</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="dhp-reflection">There are two ways of approaching our practice: one is to assume we need
to acquire something more; the other is to assume we have what we need –
but it’s just that we can’t quite locate it. In this verse the Buddha
gives us an image of hidden treasure waiting to be found. We won’t find
it outside ourselves; it is to be found in our own hearts. We don’t
recognise this treasure because we already have too much: too much
grasping, too much resisting. It is a profound blessing to meet someone
wise with discernment, ripe with compassion, who is willing to guide us
to freedom from the habits that obstruct us. They might lead us through
treacherous swamps of doubt or over threatening mountains of desire, but
only blessings can arise if we honour their example and follow the
journey to the end.</p>

<blockquote class="dhp-verse" id="page17">
  <p>All states of being are determined by mind.<br />
It is mind that leads the way.<br />
Just as the wheel of the oxcart follows<br />
the hoof-print of the animal that draws it,<br />
so suffering will surely follow<br />
when we speak or act impulsively<br />
from an impure state of mind.</p>

  <p><em>v. 1</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="dhp-reflection">Thinking too much can complicate spiritual practice; not thinking enough
can restrict us. Here we are given an example of wisely-directed
thinking. It helps us to see that we are not a victim of circumstance,
to understand that the intention behind our actions of body and speech
determines our state of being; it puts us in the position where we have
the power to bring about real change. Accepting this teaching as our
field of investigation, we appreciate the value of exercising mindful
restraint and find new confidence and ability. Our heart/mind leads the
way.</p>

<blockquote class="dhp-verse" id="page18">
  <p>Having performed a wholesome act<br />
it is good to repeat it.<br />
Enjoy the pleasure of its memory.<br />
The fruit of goodness is contentment.</p>

  <p><em>v. 118</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="dhp-reflection">The Dhamma encourages us to bring to heart the memory of wholesome acts
performed by body, speech or mind, and to dwell in the sense of gladness
that arises with that recollection. We are not at risk of becoming
overly pleased with ourselves if mindfulness is present. We can
similarly contemplate our mistakes and shortcomings without losing sight
of our goodness if we have developed wise reflection. That we can
observe our habits shows we are much more than those habits. What is it
that observes? This is our refuge – awareness, the way out of suffering.
With this very awareness we can freely dwell in the joy of recollecting
goodness. And what a relief to find that we can make mistakes and learn
from them.</p>

<blockquote class="dhp-verse" id="page19">
  <p>Let go of that which is in front,<br />
let go of that which has already gone,<br />
and let go of in-between.<br />
With a heart that takes hold nowhere<br />
you arrive at the place beyond all suffering.</p>

  <p><em>v. 348</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="dhp-reflection">We can comfortably lose ourselves in ideas of the future. We can
comfortably dwell in memories of the past. And we readily get lost in
experiences here and now. When we get lost we suffer. But suffering is
not ultimate; there are causes for suffering and there is freedom from
them. To arrive at freedom requires that we are willing to leave our
familiar abidings. We hear the instruction to ‘let go’ and it can sound
as if we are being told to get rid of something or that we are wrong for
being the way we are. But if we recognise the power of right
mindfulness, we see letting go just happens. In this verse the Buddha
meets us in the place of our suffering and directs us towards an open
door out of it.</p>

<blockquote class="dhp-verse" id="page20">
  <p>The sun shines by day,<br />
the moon shines by night.<br />
But, both all day and all night<br />
the Buddha shines<br />
in glorious splendour.</p>

  <p><em>v. 387</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="dhp-reflection">Whenever there is well-established mindfulness, there are beauty,
clarity and the possibility for deepening understanding. If there is
constant mindfulness, there is constant clarity. All day and all night
the heart of mindfulness shines in glorious splendour.</p>

<blockquote class="dhp-verse" id="page21">
  <p>Do not ignore the effect of right action<br />
saying, “This will come to nothing.”<br />
Just as by the gradual fall of raindrops<br />
the water jar is filled,<br />
so in time the wise become replete with good.</p>

  <p><em>v. 122</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="dhp-reflection">‘Bigger is better’. ‘The more the merrier’. Little by little such
perceptions can be wisely questioned. Trust that every small moment of
mindfulness matters. Every small effort to remember to come back and
with judgement-free awareness to begin again makes a difference. No such
effort is ever wasted. One day we discover we are simply unimpressed by
that which previously held us. Instead of reacting to something that in
the past would upset us, letting go happens. Wisdom knows the way of
true goodness.</p>

<blockquote class="dhp-verse" id="page22">
  <p>If spoken to harshly,<br />
make yourself as silent as a cracked gong;<br />
non-retaliation is a sign of freedom.</p>

  <p><em>v. 134</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="dhp-reflection">When we receive unjustified criticism it can be hard to restrain the
up-thrusts of passion. Pushing strong feelings down into unawareness
isn’t helpful. Practice means finding the space within ourselves to feel
what we feel, without ‘becoming’ those feelings. It is a special skill.
Watch out for any voice preaching at you: “You shouldn’t be this way,
you should know better by now.” We acknowledge the fact of how it is in
this moment. Accept the present reality into awareness, knowing it as it
is; not indulging, not pushing away. Now the energy of our passions can
fuel the process of purification, burning out the pollutions rather than
burning us out with self-criticism.</p>

<blockquote class="dhp-verse" id="page23">
  <p>Having empathy for others<br />
one sees that all beings<br />
love life and fear death.<br />
Knowing this,<br />
one does not attack or cause attack.</p>

  <p><em>v. 130</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="dhp-reflection">By being open to others we bring benefit to ourselves. In studying our
own hearts and minds we generate benefit for others. Dhamma teaches us
to practise on both levels. On one level we cultivate insight that
undoes deeply held views about ‘self’ and ‘others’. This is our formal
practice. Meanwhile our daily-life practice calls us to accept the
relative validity of views like ‘self’ and ‘others’; to engage them in
the cultivation of compassion and kindness. Empathy is a companion of
insight and helps keep practice balanced.</p>

<blockquote class="dhp-verse" id="page24">
  <p>Those who are envious, stingy and manipulative<br />
remain unappealing despite good looks<br />
and eloquent speech.<br />
But those who have freed themselves<br />
from their faults<br />
and arrived at wisdom<br />
are attractive indeed.</p>

  <p><em>v. 262-263</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="dhp-reflection">We need to remind ourselves that the way things appear to be is not
necessarily the way things ‘are’. If we listen from the heart to someone
as they speak, instead of listening only with our ears, we will hear
something quite different. When we view others from a quiet centred
place deep within, we see much more than that which our eyes see.</p>

<blockquote class="dhp-verse" id="page25">
  <p>Committed evil-doers behave toward themselves<br />
like their own worst enemies.<br />
They are like creepers that strangle the trees<br />
which support them.</p>

  <p><em>v. 162</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="dhp-reflection">This verse refers to a monk who tried three times to kill the Buddha,
and eventually his evil actions contributed to his own death. When we
betray our heart’s commitment to reality, slowly but surely we die away
from the light of truth and sink into darkness. Creepers climb handsome
mature trees and sometimes strangle them to death. We can go for refuge
to the Buddha, yet still be taken over by up-thrusts of rage. Hours,
days or even years go by as we justify our hurtful actions of body or
speech. When we come to see the truth of our actions a wholesome sense
of remorse arises; we genuinely wish to desist. Right action is the
natural consequence.</p>

<blockquote class="dhp-verse" id="page26">
  <p>A renunciate does not oppress anyone.<br />
Patient endurance is the ultimate asceticism.<br />
Profound liberation, say the Buddhas,<br />
is the supreme goal.</p>

  <p><em>v. 184</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="dhp-reflection">As we progress on our path towards the goal, the Buddha is encouraging
us not to forget how we relate to others. The cultivation of <em>mettā</em>
teaches us to include all beings in our heart of kindness. It sometimes
happens that we feel able to be kind towards others but not towards
ourselves. If we find this a struggle, we show infinite kindness towards
the struggler, ourselves. Layers of self-judging, self-loathing,
self-rejecting require us to exercise patient endurance; not to be
mistaken for bitter endurance. Patience is an essential characteristic
for those travelling on the path. And there is absolutely no way this
essential virtue can be cultivated when we are having a good time. So
when we are having a bad time, we can reflect that this is the perfect
place, the only place, to develop this profound quality.</p>

<blockquote class="dhp-verse" id="page27">
  <p>Those who are contentious<br />
have forgotten that we all die;<br />
for the wise, who reflect on this fact,<br />
there are no quarrels.</p>

  <p><em>v. 6</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="dhp-reflection">It is OK to think about death and to talk about the fact that we will
all die. Indeed, it is wise to do so. If we deny the awareness of our
mortality, the fear of it remains hidden underground. With this
avoidance of reality comes diminishing aliveness and increased
confusion. Cultivating mindfulness around the subject of death
(<em>maraṇasati</em>) we discover that to the degree that we admit reality
there is a corresponding increase in clarity and contentment. This is
the contentment that leads to meaningful peace.</p>

<blockquote class="dhp-verse" id="page28">
  <p>All states of being are determined by mind.<br />
It is mind that leads the way.<br />
As surely as our shadow never leaves us,<br />
so well-being will follow when we speak or act<br />
with a pure state of mind.</p>

  <p><em>v. 2</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="dhp-reflection">Have you ever tried to run away from your shadow? As hard as you might
try it never leaves you. Any action by body, speech or mind that is done
with pure motivation will indeed lead to increased well-being. This is
worth remembering if we intend to do something good and are about to
change our minds, thinking it’s not worth the effort. However small and
apparently insignificant the act might be, happiness will follow. It is
worth doing.</p>

<blockquote class="dhp-verse" id="page29">
  <p>When we hold fast to such thoughts as,<br />
“They abused me, mistreated me,<br />
molested me, robbed me,”<br />
we keep hatred alive.</p>

  <p><em>v. 3-4</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="dhp-reflection">If we thoroughly release ourselves<br />
from such thoughts as,<br />
“They abused me, mistreated me,<br />
molested me, robbed me,”<br />
hatred is vanquished.</p>

<p>In various ways we all suffer injustice in our lives. Sometimes the pain
runs deep and can last for years. Dhamma teachings emphasise not so much
the pain as our relationship to it. As long as we are possessed by
hatred and resistance, intelligence is compromised. Although action
might be called for, if our heart is not free from hatred, we can’t know
what right action would be. The Buddha advocates releasing ourselves
from thoughts of hatred. It takes strength, patience and determination
to let go. We are not letting go because someone else told us we should.
We are letting go because we understand the consequences of hanging on.</p>

<blockquote class="dhp-verse" id="page30">
  <p>As old flowers fall<br />

  <p><em>v. 377</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="dhp-reflection">Ajahn Chah was in London, staying at the Hampstead Vihara. The monks
were troubled by the noise that was coming from the pub across the road.
Ajahn Chah told them that the cause of suffering was their sending
attention out to trouble the sound. Sound itself is just so. Suffering
only arises when we ‘go out’ and add something extra. Seeing our part in
creating problems, a shift in the way we view them takes place. Instead
of blaming, we simply ‘see’ what we are doing, in the moment. Let’s not
get into a fight with hatred; exercising careful restraint and wise
reflection, we let it ‘fall away’. Initially we see this only after we
have reacted and created suffering. With practice we catch it sooner.
One day, we will catch ourselves just as we are about to create the
problem.</p>

<blockquote class="dhp-verse" id="page31">
  <p>As water slides from a lotus leaf,<br />
so sensual pleasures<br />
do not cling<br />
to a great being.</p>

  <p><em>v. 401</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="dhp-reflection">A great being is great because he or she is free from obstructions in
their relationship with life. We are not so great because we get caught
in feelings and make a problem out of life. We create obstructions by
the way that we deal with the eight worldly dhammas: praise and blame,
gain and loss, pleasure and suffering, popularity and insignificance.
Out of delusion we relate to these worldly winds heedlessly, indulging
in what we like and resisting what we don’t. Wisdom on the other hand
simply sees the reality of the sensory world. It knows the space within
which all experiences arise and cease. Such knowing means that a great
being doesn’t even have to try to let go; all inclination to cling
automatically falls away. He or she experiences sensual pleasure, but
adds nothing to it and takes nothing away.</p>

<blockquote class="dhp-verse" id="page32">
  <p>Never by hatred is hatred conquered,<br />

</blockquote>

<p class="dhp-reflection">To conquer hatred ‘by love alone’ can seem a lofty ideal. We might judge
ourselves (and in so doing tend to excuse ourselves) as being too
limited – or just dismiss the notion as not realistic. Surely part of us
does say, ‘yes’. Another part of us might say, ‘Yes, but what if…’ For
the Buddha there are no qualifications; hatred simply never works. What
is this word ‘love’? Generating an unqualified receptivity? And the
perceptions we have of those who might trigger hatred within us; where
do those perceptions exist? Potentially loving-kindness is capable of
receiving all of this into awareness, fully, wholly, even warmly. This
is eternal law.</p>

  <p><em>v. 142</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="dhp-reflection">Outer forms are not what really matter. The Buddha always pointed to the
heart, the place we need to focus. He emphasised this because we easily
forget, becoming too concerned with how things appear. This verse is
about an inebriated householder, shocked by massive disappointment into
despair. The Buddha’s teachings, pointing directly at that which really
matters, transformed his despair; instead of falling apart, he realised
perfect unconditioned peace. When the focus of our practice is merely on
forms and appearances, spirit is compromised. Straining too much for the
ultimate explanation of the five precepts, for example, may stop us from
seeing the intention behind the action. The form of the precepts is
there so we become mindful of our motivation. Holding the precepts
correctly, there is a chance they will serve their true purpose. Correct
living is noble being.</p>

  <p><em>v. 95</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="dhp-reflection">The Buddha lived in this world as we do. And despite all the turmoil he
realised a state of imperturbability - to ‘become patient as the earth’.
Whatever is poured on it, burnt on it or done to it, the earth just goes
on being what it is, doing what it does. Patient endurance is not a weak
option; it is strengthening and kind. With patient endurance we discover
the ability to allow our present experience to be here, just as it is,
until we have learned what we need to learn.</p>

</blockquote>

<p class="dhp-reflection">You are under pressure to make a decision. Is it possible to remain cool
and calm when others want you to decide in their favour? Can you remain
free from bias and arrive at a just decision? How do we hold our views?
Having a strong opinion can feel great; it can appear as confidence. But
such is the nature of fundamentalism; so too is providing simplistic
answers to complex questions. Rigid views and simplistic solutions are
not aspects of a spacious mind, a mind that can consider all aspects of
a dilemma. It usually takes time to arrive at a balanced, thoroughly
considered view. It also requires an ability to listen from a place of
inner quiet. If we are mentally preparing our rebuttal, we are not
really listening.</p>

  <p><em>v. 120</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="dhp-reflection">Trusting in true principles is not always easy. Pursuing popular opinion
is not always wise. Not being dissuaded by doubts or mere speculation,
we see how our deepest questions about reality lead us to insight. Trust
is a force for transformation; so too is patience. It is almost
unimaginable how an acorn can grow into an oak tree, but it does. We
need trust. We need patience. Like trees, these forces for
transformation can be cultivated and inspire us towards that which is
inwardly great and inherently free of all suffering.</p>

</blockquote>

<p class="dhp-reflection">It is time to move on. We might know this on one level, yet another part
of us holds back. If we attempt to let go because we think we should –
instead of discovering renewed inspiration – there will be resistance.
But encountering disappointment is OK too if we are alert to our heart’s
true needs. Our deepest need is to be free from ignorance. There is no
place where we can truly settle until we have fully realised who and
what we are. This path of awareness has the power to transform
absolutely everything into understanding. Swans glide on – no
resistance.</p>

  <p>Transform anger with kindness<br />
and evil with good,<br />
meanness with generosity<br />
and deceit with integrity.</p>

  <p><em>v. 223</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="dhp-reflection">If we are cold, we find a way to get warm – we don’t subject ourselves
to more cold. If we are hungry we eat – we don’t further deprive
ourselves of food. If we are angry, we don’t fight it with rage – we try
to be kind to this being that is suffering from anger. If we witness
evil actions, we generate sincere goodness and restrain any impulse to
reject the evil-doers with mere judgment. To people who believe
self-centred meanness is the path to contentment we give generosity. And
with those who are deceitful we speak truth. This may not be easy. This
is the way of transformation.</p>

<blockquote class="dhp-verse" id="page39">
  <p>Those who speak much<br />
are not necessarily possessed of wisdom.<br />
The wise can be seen to be at peace with life<br />

  <p><em>v. 258</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="dhp-reflection">Struggling to become peaceful and wise often stirs things up, while
carefully allowing the activity of heart and mind to cease naturally
calms things down. Wisdom is not discovered by following habits of
seeking that which we like. When pain and disappointment come to us we
can learn to meet them with a quality of willingness and awareness that
leads to understanding. When happiness and delight come we can be
refreshed and renewed by our experience, without becoming lost in them.
Enmity and fear are not necessarily obstacles. They can be our teachers,
pointing to a more spacious and wise way of living.</p>

<blockquote class="dhp-verse" id="page40">

  <p><em>v. 82</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="dhp-reflection">We might think, “If the Buddha were here today to teach me, I too could
get enlightened.” However, when the Buddha was around there were many
who met him, heard him, lived with him and yet didn’t recognise him or
the Truth to which he was pointing. At the end of his life one of the
monks asked the Buddha who would take his place when he was gone, to
which he replied that the Dhamma would take his place. On an earlier
occasion he had taught that seeing the Dhamma was the same as seeing the
Buddha. Listening to Dhamma is attending fully to and contemplating
wisely that which is happening right now. So we don’t need to feel bad
because we can’t listen to a talk directly from the Buddha. We learn to
be more receptive to life.</p>

  <p><em>v. 173</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="dhp-reflection">The darkness of the world comes from habits of avoidance and indulgence.
Wholesome acts uncover the light that is already here. Paying attention
to old worn-out ways in the right manner, at the right time, with
here-and-now, judgement-free, body-mind awareness, leads to
transformation. We don’t have to get rid of anything. We don’t have any
bad stuff. Painful memories, painful sensations do not have to become
suffering. With right attention everything leads to increased light.</p>

</blockquote>

<p class="dhp-reflection">Is what I am doing with my life giving me what I am looking for? We do
succeed from time to time in gratifying our wishes, but lasting
happiness comes only from being freed of the irritation of wanting. If
we ask ourselves the right questions at the right time, a radically
different view is revealed: the way of contentment draws us inwards, not
outwards. Rather than following an impulse to want more, we can look
directly at the wanting itself. And for a moment the sting of craving
ceases. We have learned a little more about what it means to be a
disciple of the Buddha.</p>

  <p><em>v. 14</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="dhp-reflection">We act to protect ourselves from the elements of wind and rain. With
wise reflection we act to protect ourselves from the wild passions. This
is heart-training. Skilfully addressing the damage caused by greed and
ill will is an important aspect of Right Action. It is not an avoidance
of the passions; neither is it indulging in them. Between these two we
seek the middle way.</p>

<blockquote class="dhp-verse" id="page44">

</blockquote>

<p class="dhp-reflection">Is it possible to have too much modesty? It is possible to have the
wrong kind of modesty, when, for example, refraining from blatant greed
is being manipulative. Modesty, frugality and discipline: words like
these can make us feel uneasy. Yet certainly there are timeless
principles encoded in them. When we have true modesty we look for the
“right amount” of things. We seek the difference between settling for
“good enough” and being too timid to excel. With right discipline we are
focused on the task at hand without compromising sensitivity. One
skilled in right discipline can say no when needed, not out of judgement
or mere preference, but as someone who cares.</p>

  <p><em>v. 49</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="dhp-reflection">The world is our village. Can we move through our world without
disturbing that which is beautiful about it? Sages and renunciates might
live on alms-food gathered from the village, but most people need to use
money. There is nothing inherently wrong about money. It is a symbol for
the energy with which we interact in our world. The Buddha’s guidelines
on cultivating Right Livelihood indicate harmless and considerate ways
of stewarding this energy. When we forget ourselves we focus too much on
how good it will be when we get what we want, not attending to the way
we go about getting it. Care is needed both in what we do and how we do
it.</p>

<blockquote class="dhp-verse" id="page46">

</blockquote>

<p class="dhp-reflection">When actions of body and speech are an expression of inner ease, we find
the realm of relationships more rewarding. It’s not by merely following
our wish to be liked or any other gratification of desire that we live
with lasting happiness; rather, it is by appreciating where the true
causes for contentment lie. Even wholesome wishes, if held too tightly,
can lead to discontentment. It’s clinging that’s the problem. When we
see our habits of clinging clearly, at that time and in that place we
also see how we don’t have to cling; we find the way out.</p>

<blockquote class="dhp-verse" id="page47">

  <p><em>v. 20</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="dhp-reflection">It doesn’t matter that we don’t know all there is to know about Dhamma.
It is how we apply the teachings that counts. Are we living
wholeheartedly according with what we have learned? This is a more
useful line of enquiry than, ‘When can I go on another retreat?’ or ‘If
I could only knuckle down to more study.’ Such questions are OK if they
lead us to releasing attachments, but not if they are an expression of
our addiction to always wanting or becoming more. If what is needed is a
subtle shift of attention to simply being more mindful in the present
moment, even striving hard for profound insights obstructs our progress.
A moment of recognising this truth and we experience for ourselves the
benefit of walking the Way.</p>

<blockquote class="dhp-verse" id="page48">
  <p>Beings naturally experience pleasure;<br />
but when pleasure is contaminated with craving,<br />

  <p><em>v. 341</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="dhp-reflection">With the right quality of mindfulness at the right moment, we can see
why and how attaching to joy and sorrow perpetuates suffering. We become
interested in how to experience pleasure without making it “my”
pleasure, or creating an “I” that is having a good time. Wise reflection
shows us that when attachment is taken out of the experience happiness
isn’t diminished – in fact, it is enhanced. When we are accurately
aware, intelligence functions in the service of insight. If we
appreciate how grasping at the pleasure spoils the beauty, ease of being
emerges.</p>

<blockquote class="dhp-verse" id="page49">
  <p>To many places beings withdraw<br />

But none of these places offer true refuge,<br />

  <p><em>v. 188-189</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="dhp-reflection">It is hard to feel afraid without thinking something is going wrong. We
readily react by judging ourselves and others, in an attempt to escape
the pain of fear. It doesn’t work – neither does running off into the
wilds. Even sacred places are deemed to fail us if we are motivated by a
wish to escape. Turning to our refuge in Dhamma, however, can trigger an
interest in understanding fear and learning from it. Can we experience
the fear sensation without ‘becoming’ afraid? Fear is still fear, but it
is perceived from an expanded, less cramped and less threatened
awareness. We can even begin to see that fear too is “just so.” A
non-judgemental, whole body-mind acknowledgement of the condition of
fear, here and now, can transform our pain into freedom. Willingness to
meet ourselves where we find ourselves is the way.</p>

<blockquote class="dhp-verse" id="page50">

</blockquote>

<p class="dhp-reflection">Associating with wise beings is certainly a blessing, but it is not
always easy. Their openness can contrast painfully with our
contractedness. However, wise beings are also compassionate, so it is
easier to take the medicine. Eventually we feel grateful. After his
enlightenment the Buddha felt so much gratitude for his previous
teachers that one of the first things he did was try to find them and
pass on what he had discovered. We too can reflect with gratitude on all
those who have helped us take steps on this path. Dwelling on gratitude
it is heart nourishment; it aligns us with the wise.</p>

<blockquote class="dhp-verse" id="page51">
  <p>The Buddha’s perfection is complete;<br />
there is no more work to be done.<br />
No measure is there for his wisdom;<br />
no limits are there to be found.<br />
In what way could he be distracted from truth?</p>

  <p><em>v. 179</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="dhp-reflection">There is a real reality that can be known; the Buddha knew it. It is
possible to awaken beyond all the feelings of limitation that lead to
disappointment and regret. Skilfully trusting in the Buddha’s
enlightenment establishes an inner frame of reference. When we find
ourselves disoriented by life we realign ourselves by engaging this
trust. Trust is an inner structure, like the sails on a yacht; when
rightly set they capture the wind which powers the vessel onwards.</p>

<blockquote class="dhp-verse" id="page52">
  <p>For many lives I have wandered<br />

the ridge-pole is broken.<br />
All craving is ended;<br />
my heart is as one<br />

  <p><em>v. 153-154</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="dhp-reflection">The Buddha’s final and complete realisation was to discover that he had
been believing in something that was not true. He had been deceived by
what he calls the house-builder. The houses are the structures of mind;
the ‘me’ and the ‘mine’ we take so seriously. “It is me that is
longing.” “It is me that is feeling disappointed.” “It is my mood, my
body, my mind.” He saw clearly how these impressions had been
constructed by the habits of craving. Having penetrated this with
profound insight, he understood the process; the mainstay of the house,
the ridge-pole, was broken and suffering had ended. Wandering around
hoping for a solution to his struggles was over. From then on, he would
abide at ease in the state prior to all arising and ceasing; the unmade,
the undying reality.</p>
